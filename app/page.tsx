            We started bootlegging Aiken Validators during the prohibition...
            Back when the Cardano streets were mean and the validators were
            scarce. Gimbalabs incubated us.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Dons ran the underground validator circuit, smuggling code
            through the back channels of the blockchain. "The Capo" - that's
            what they called us. We were the ones who could read you a hot
            validator when nobody else could.
